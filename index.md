# Research Experience
* Information System Laboratory, KAIST (Feb 2019 ~ Jan 2020)
  * Undergraduate Researcher. Advisor : Changho Suh
  * Studied on the fairness and robustness of deep learning model.
* CS Automation Project, Devsisters
  * Project Lead
  * Automated replying for specific CS(Customer Service) tickets. Applied few-shot learning to deal with new kind of tickets.
  * DEVIEW 2017 : Customer Service Response using Machine Learning [[link]](https://deview.kr/2017/schedule/196?lang=en)
* Network Intelligence and Analytics Lab, KAIST

# Work Experience
* Software Engineer @Devsisters (Jan 2016 ~ Feb 2019)
  * **Game Server(CookieRun:Ovenbreak)**: Designed and implemented a game server based on HTTP API for CookieRun:Ovenbreak(CRO), which has at most 1 million daily active users. Mainly contributed to loot box system, social interactions, userdata migration, and coupon usage system.
  * **Infra Management**: Managed all server resources related to CRO including game server, back-office tools, database, logging infra, and network configurations as code using Terraform.
  * **Network Layer**: Implemented a custom protocol and robust network layer code based on UDP for a real-time game, which supports selective retransmission, packet compression, and authentication.
  * **Real-time Game Logic**: Solely achieved high performance of real-time game logic with parallel programming on layered architectures.
